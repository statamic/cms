## What You Should Know Before Contributing

### Statamic isn’t FOSS

While Statamic's source code is open source, publicly available, and can be [used for free](https://statamic.dev/licensing#solo-vs-pro) in many cases, it is proprietary. Everything in this repo, including any community-contributed code, is the property of Statamic LLC. For that reason there are a few limitations on how you can use the code:

- You cannot alter anything related to licensing, updating, version or edition checking, purchasing, first party notifications or banners, or anything else that attempts to circumvent paying for features that are designated as Statamic Pro features. We want to stay in business so we can better support _you_ and the community.
- You can’t publicly maintain a long-term fork of Statamic.

### How to Get Support

If you're looking for official developer support (and you have an active license), please visit [statamic.com/support](https://statamic.com/support). We will always do our best to reply in a timely manner. **Github issues are intended for reporting bugs.**

You can chat and collaborate with other developers in the community in [Github Discussions](https://github.com/statamic/cms/discussions) or [Discord](https://statamic.com/discord). You will find many helpful folks who may be willing to help.

## How You Can Contribute

### Which Repo?

Statamic is broken out into a few Github repositories. Here's a quick summary of each.

- [`statamic/cms`](https://github.com/statamic/cms) is the core package. It doesn't run by itself but is instead a dependency consumed by Laravel apps. 99% of the work goes on here.
- [`statamic/statamic`](https://github.com/statamic/statamic) is the starter Laravel app used to build a new site.
- [`statamic/docs`](https://github.com/statamic/docs) is the Statamic documentation site that is curently running on [statamic.dev](https://statamic.dev).

### Bug Reports

First things first. If the bug is security related refer to our [security disclosures](#security-disclosures) procedures instead of opening an issue.

Next, please search through the [open issues](https://github.com/statamic/cms/issues) to see if it has already been opened.

If you _do_ find a similar issue, upvote it by adding a :thumbsup: [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Only leave a comment if you have relevant information to add.

If no one has filed the issue yet, feel free to [submit a new one](https://github.com/statamic/cms/issues/new). Please include a clear description of the issue, follow along with the issue template, and provide and as much relevant information as possible. Code examples demonstrating the issue are the best way to ensure a timely solution to the issue.

### Feature Requests

Feature requests should be created in the [statamic/ideas](https://github.com/statamic/ideas) repository.

### Security Disclosures

If you discover a security vulnerability, please review our [Security Policy](https://github.com/statamic/cms/security/policy), then report the issue directly to us from [statamic.com/support](https://statamic.com/support). We will review and respond privately via email.

### Documentation Edits

Statamic's documentation lives in the [https://github.com/statamic/docs](https://github.com/statamic/docs) repository. Improvements or corrections to them can be submitted as a pull request.

### Core Enhancements

If you would like to work on a new core feature or improvement, first create a [Github issue](https://github.com/statamic/cms/issues) for it if there’s not one already. While we appreciate community contributions, we do remain selective about what features make it into Statamic itself, so don’t take it the wrong way if we recommend that you pursue the idea as an addon instead.

### Compiled Assets

If you are submitting a change that will affect a compiled file, such as most of the files in `resources/sass` or `resources/js`, do not commit the compiled files. Due to their large size, they cannot realistically be reviewed by our team. This could be exploited as a way to inject malicious code into Statamic. In order to defensively prevent this, all compiled files will be generated and committed by the core Statamic team.

### Control Panel Translations

We welcome new translations and updates! Please follow [these instructions](https://statamic.dev/cp-translations#contributing-a-new-translation) on how to contribute to Statamic's translation files.

### Pull Requests

Pull requests should clearly describe the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if there is one. If the pull request fixes a bug, it should include a new test case that demonstrates the issue, if possible.

PR titles should include the major version number they're targeted at — e.g. [4.x] or [3.x].
