First of all, thank _you_ 🫵 for taking the time to contribute to Statamic, we really appreciate it! 💜

Please take 30 seconds to read the following so we can be as efficient as possible when reviewing and considering merging PRs:

1️⃣ Is this your first PR? If so, please read our [contribution guide](https://statamic.dev/contribution-guide) first.

2️⃣ Please make sure to create a new branch for your PR.

3️⃣ Typically you should target the branch of the most current release, e.g. `5.x`, unless your PR includes a breaking change, in which case you should target the `master` branch for the next major release.

4️⃣ We _really_ appreciate it if your PR includes tests. This makes it much easier for us to review, merge, and release. A PR with tests is usually reviewed and merged 5x-10x faster.

5️⃣ If your PR introduce a new feature, adds to an existing one, or changes current behavior, please **open an issue for it in the [statamic/docs](https://github.com/statamic/docs/issues) repo referencing your PR**. A simple "Goes along with statamic/cms#9000" is enough. Otherwise it's really easy to forget and no will ever become aware of your ✨ sparkling ✨ invention if it's not documented.

6️⃣ Remove this placeholder text and replace it with a description of what this PR is doing.
