# Badge
Badges are used to display labels, status indicators, counts, and other metadata. They come in many colors and sizes.
<Canvas of={BadgeStories._DocsIntro} />

## Sizes
Badges are available in multiple sizes via the `size` prop.
<Canvas of={BadgeStories.Sizes} />

## Colors
Use the `color` prop to change the badge's color.
<Canvas of={BadgeStories.Colors} />

## Append & Prepend
Use the `append` and `prepend` props to add smaller supporting text before or after the main text, perfect for counts, numbers, and other small details.
<Canvas of={BadgeStories._AppendPrependDocs} />

## Icons
Automatically sized and styled icons are available for your badges using the `icon` or `icon-append` props to pass the name of an icon.
<Canvas of={BadgeStories._IconDocs} />

## Pills
Use the `pill` prop to round out the badge.
<Canvas of={BadgeStories.Pill} />

## As a Link
Badges can be used as links by passing an `href` prop. They will use Inertia to navigate unless you add `target="_blank"` to open in a new tab.
