# Select
Displays a list of options for the user to pick from—triggered by an input style button.
<Canvas of={SelectStories._DocsIntro} sourceState={'shown'} />

## Data Format
Pass data into the select with the `options` prop as an array of objects. The objects must contain a `value` and a `label`, but can contain any other day you would like as well.

## Sizes
Use the `size` prop to control the input's height and type scale. The scales match the button sizes to make sure everything lines up nicely.

## Variants
Use the `variant` prop to change the appearance of the select.
<Canvas of={SelectStories._Variants} sourceState={'shown'} />

## Clearable
Add a clear button to your select by setting the `clearable` prop.

## Icon

## Custom List Items
You can customize the markup and display of the list items inside of an `#options` slot, with full access to whatever data is passed into the select.
