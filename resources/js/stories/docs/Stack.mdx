# Stack
Stacks are a good way of adding a layer of UX to the Control Panel.

For example, when editing a related entry while you're already editing another entry would open a second publish form over the top. Once you're done, the layer would close and return you to your original task, without you losing any progress, or needing to navigate away.

## Title
Titles are required for accessibility, but you don't have to use the `title` prop if you want to style it differently. You have full control of the style and content by using the `StackTitle` component.
<Canvas of={StackStories._CustomTitle} sourceState={'shown'} />

## Close Button
You can use the `StackClose` component to close the stack.
<Canvas of={StackStories._CloseButton} sourceState={'shown'} />

## Icon
You can add an icon to the title by passing the `icon` prop.
<Canvas of={StackStories._WithIcon} sourceState={'shown'} />

## Preventing Stacks from closing
Before a Stack is closed, you have the opportunity to cancel it. For instance, if your Stack contains a form, you may want to give a warning about unsaved changes when the user tries to close it. To prevent closing of a Stack, you should pass in a function that returns false to stop closing and true to allow it.
