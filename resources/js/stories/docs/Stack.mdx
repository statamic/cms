# Stack
Stacks are a good way of adding a layer of UX to the Control Panel. Ideal for short forms or editing related content.
<Canvas of={StackStories._DocsIntro} sourceState={'shown'} />

## Title
Titles are required for accessibility, but you don't have to use the `title` prop if you want to style it differently. You have full control of the style and content by using the `StackTitle` component.
<Canvas of={StackStories._CustomTitle} sourceState={'shown'} />

## Close Button
You can use the `StackClose` component to close the stack.
<Canvas of={StackStories._CloseButton} sourceState={'shown'} />

## Icon
You can add an icon to the title by passing the `icon` prop.
<Canvas of={StackStories._WithIcon} sourceState={'shown'} />

## Arguments
<ArgTypes of={StackStories} />
