# Button
Buttons are used to trigger actions. They come in many sizes and flavors.
<Canvas of={ButtonStories._DocsIntro} />

## Variants
Use the `variant` prop to change the appearance of the button.
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Variants} />

## Sizes
Use the `size` prop to change the size of the button.
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Sizes} />

## Icons
Automatically sized and styled icons are available for your buttons using the `icon` or `icon-append` props. You can also compose your own buttons with icons by nesting an [Icon]() component.
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Icons} />

## Round
Round buttons have their place too — like Bard set pickers. Just set the `round` prop.
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Round} />

## Loading
Show an animated loading icon during network requests.
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Loading} />

## Full Width
Fill that container with nothing but button.
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.FullWidth} />

## As a Link
Buttons can be used as links by passing an `href` prop. They will use Inertia to navigate unless you add `target="_blank"` to open in a new tab.
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Link} />

## Inset
When using `ghost` or `subtle` button variants, you can use the `inset` prop to remove any invisible padding for better alignment.
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Inset} />
