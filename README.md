## About Statamic 3

Statamic 3 is the very latest and greatest version of Statamic, a uniquely powerful CMS built on [Laravel](https://laravel.com) and designed to make building and managing bespoke websites radically efficient and enjoyable.

It's important to note that while this repo is open and we welcome your feedback and contributions, Statamic is not FOSS (Free and Open Source Software). Please review our [contribution guidelines][contribution] guidelines for more details!

> **Note:** This repository contains the code for the core CMS package. To start your own website project with Statamic, visit the [Statamic application repository][app-repo].


## Open Beta

Statamic 3 is now in **open beta!** We welcome you try it out, [read the docs](https://statamic.dev), experiment, send [bug reports][contribution], provide thoughtful feedback, and otherwise do anything you feel will make the platform better and more stable for launch.

If this is your first experience with Statamic, please reserve your final judgement until we're out of beta. We've built a solid and flexible foundation and most bugs and rough edges should be minor efforts to address.


### Not for Production Use

**Statamic 3 Beta is NOT intended for production use.** You may encounter show-stopping bugs. Features may be removed last minute. There may still be **breaking changes** resulting in tedious manual labor and refactoring on _your_ end to get back in sync with master.

So when you're tempted to launch that site you built anyway even after reading this warning, just remember &mdash; we told you not to do it and we still love you. :heart:


### Pricing, Editions, and Features

**Statamic is commercial, paid software** (Statamic v2 is $199/site). During the beta you're welcome to use Statamic as much as you'd like in development for free. Start new projects, upgrade your v2 sites, build addons, try dropping it into existing Laravel apps, and so on. When we launch Statamic 3 all you'll need to do is buy or upgrade the appropriate license and be on your way.

After the beta there may be changes to pricing, new or different editions, and other changes to how the features and capabilities are organized. But since you're not going to use Statamic 3 Beta in production it shouldn't be much an issue, right? :blush:


## Learning Statamic

Statamic 3 has extensive (in progress) [documentation][docs]. We dedicate a significant amount of time and energy every day to improving them, so if something is unclear, wait a day or two and check back again. If it's still confusing, feel free to open an issue or chat with us on [Discord][discord] about it!


## Support & Feedback

We aren't able to provide "official support" for Statamic 3 in the way we do for Statamic 2. This is a beta, after all. We prefer to think of this phase as a collaborative process. And while we **do not** recommend using Statamic 3 in production, we **do** want to know about any issues you run into, any aspects that are confusing, and anything that is horribly broken. Please review the [contribution guide][contribution] before opening issues or pull requests. Thanks!


### Discord

Our [#v3 channel][discord] is the best place to casually chat with us and other developers about the Statamic 3 beta.
